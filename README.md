# okta-jwt

This is a simple JWT package built to work specifically with Okta's API Access Management product (API AM). It was inspried in part by jpadilla's PyJWT package (https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt). This is not meant to be a full implementation of RFC 7519 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519), but rather a subset of JWT operations specific to Okta API AM.
